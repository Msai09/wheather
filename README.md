# Weather Data Analysis

This Python script analyzes weather data using various data exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


The script will load weather data from the 'weather.csv' file, perform data exploration, visualization, and machine learning analysis, and print out the results.

Contents
weather.csv: CSV file containing weather data.
weather_analysis.py: Python script for data analysis.
Steps Performed
Load the Data: Load weather data from the 'weather.csv' file.
Data Exploration: Display basic information about the dataset.
Data Visualization: Visualize relationships between variables using pair plots.
Feature Engineering: Extract month from the date column for further analysis.
Data Analysis: Analyze average maximum temperature by month.
Data Visualization (Part 2): Plot monthly average maximum temperature.
Advanced Analysis: Predict rainfall using linear regression.
Conclusions and Insights: Identify highest and lowest rainfall months.
Communication: Optional section for additional communication.
Future Work: Optional section for future work.
